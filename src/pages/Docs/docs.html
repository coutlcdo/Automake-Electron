		<h1>Read the instructions carefully:</h1><p>The algorithm right now will only work if you setup the environment
		correctly.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for the Environment Setup</h2>
		<p>You need to have both gcc and MinGW properly installed and setted at PATH.</p>
		<p><strong style="color: #ff5a5a;">Important!</strong> Inside your MinGW instalation folder, go to /bin
		and be sure the file <strong>mingw32-make</strong> is <strong>exactly</strong> as written here.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for the Watcher (main functionality)</h2>
		<p class="bold">First step:</p>
		<p>Search for the folder where you keep your Allegro projects. For proper operation, I suggest that you create
		a folder to keep only the .c files and their corresponding assets.</p>
		<p class="bold">Second step:</p>
		<p>Search the folder where your Allegro library were downloaded. The name should contain the Allegro version.</p>
		<p class="bold">Third step:</p>
		<p>Now you should confirm if the path on text fields are correct and in the right order (the first text field should
		have Allegro projects folder path and the second should have Allegro library folder path)</p>
		<p>If everything is correct you can <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>

		<p>Once the paths have been submitted, you'll be redirected to the Watcher window. This means that
		<span id="automk">Automake</span> is already reading changes in the directory, you can now keep the app on
		background and work on your projects. Every time you save your project the app will automatically compile it into an
		executable.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for the Cleaner (secondary functionality)</h2>
		<p><strong style="color: #ff5a5a;">Important!</strong> The call to the Cleaner will only work if at least the Allegro folder was submitted.</p>
		<p>The Cleaner can be called clicking on the <strong>Options</strong> or simply hitting <strong>Ctrl+W
		(Command+W on Mac)</strong>.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>To check the source code go to <strong>Help</strong> and <strong>Github page</strong>.</p>

		<p>Click <strong>Home</strong> or <strong>Ctrl+H (Command+H on Mac)</strong> to go back to the homepage.</p>
