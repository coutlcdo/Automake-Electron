		<h1>Read the instructions carefully:</h1><p>Right now, the algorithm will only work if you setup the environment
		correctly.</p>

		<p>Since MinGW is needed, Windows is recommended.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for the environment setup</h2>
		<p>You need to have MinGW properly installed and setted at PATH. Links:
		<a id="allegro-link" href="#">Allegro</a>
		 // <a id="installer-link" href="#">Installer</a>
		 // <a id="guide-link" href="#">Guide</a></p>
		<p><strong style="color: #ff5a5a;">Important!</strong> Inside your MinGW instalation folder, go to /bin
		and be sure to rename the file <strong>mingw32-make</strong> to <strong>make</strong>.</p>
		<p>Remember to put the <strong>allegro-monolith dll</strong> inside your project folder.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions to g++ compiling</h2>
		<p><strong style="color: #ff5a5a;">Important!</strong> Changing compilers may cause unexpected errors, I suggest
		you that select the compiler before anything else and only once per runtime.</p>
		<p>Some aditional evironment setup is needed before compiling with g++.</p>
		<p class="bold">First step:</p>
		<p>Enter the Allegro folder and copy all the files inside <strong>lib folder</strong>.</p>
		<p class="bold">Second step:</p>
		<p>Paste the files inside the <strong>lib folder of MinGW</strong>.</p>
		<p class="bold">Third step:</p>
		<p>Repeat first and second step but for <strong>include folder</strong>.</p>
		<p>You'll need the <strong>allegro-monolith dll</strong> inside your project folder for this process too.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for the Watcher</h2>
		<p class="bold">First step:</p>
		<p>Search for the folder where you keep your Allegro projects. To avoid errors, I suggest that you create
		a folder to keep only the .c files.</p>
		<p class="bold">Second step:</p>
		<p>Search the folder where your Allegro library were downloaded. The folder name should follow this
		template: <strong>allegro-(version)-mingw-(version)</strong>.</p>
		<p class="bold">Third step:</p>
		<p>Now you should confirm if the path on text fields are correct and in the right order (the first text field should
		have Allegro projects folder path and the second should have Allegro library folder path)</p>
		<p>If everything is correct you can <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>

		<p>Once the paths have been submitted, you'll be redirected to the Watcher window. This means that Automake is
		already reading changes in the directory, you can now keep the app on background and work on your projects.
		Every time you save your project, the app will automatically compile it into an executable.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for the Cleaner</h2>
		<p><strong style="color: #ff5a5a;">Important!</strong> Calling the Cleaner will only work if at least the
		Allegro folder was submitted.</p>
		<p>The Cleaner will delete all .o and .exe files at your selected Allegro folder. It can be called selecting on the
		fourth option of <strong>File</strong> at the menu, or simply hitting <strong>Ctrl+W (Command+W on Mac)</strong>.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for saving and opening compiled programs</h2>
		<p>Once you submit, a message box will appear, choose "Yes" if you want to save your path settings.
		<strong style="color: #ff5a5a;">Important!</strong> The settings are temporarily saved, so, they may disappear
		when you reboot your computer.</p>

		<p>To load your last settings go to <strong>File</strong> and select the first option.</p>

		<p>You can also open the last compiled program, or it's folder, directly from the app. But in
		order to that you'll have to first compile the program, making a modification on it or simply saving without any.</p>

		<p>To load your last compiled program folder go to <strong>File</strong> and select the second option. If you
		want to open the last program itself select the third option or hit <strong>Ctrl+S (Command+S on Mac)</strong>.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>To check the source code go to <strong>Help</strong> and <strong>Learn More</strong>.</p>

		<p>Click <strong>Home</strong> or hit <strong>Ctrl+H (Command+H on Mac)</strong> to go back to the homepage.</p>
