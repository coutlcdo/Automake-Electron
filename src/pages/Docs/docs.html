		<h1>Read the instructions carefully:</h1><p>The algorithm right now will only work if you setup the environment
		correctly.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for the Environment Setup</h2>
		<p>You need to have both gcc and MinGW properly installed and setted at PATH.</p>
		<p><strong style="color: #ff5a5a;">Important!</strong> Inside your MinGW instalation folder, go to /bin
		and be sure to rename the file <strong>mingw32-make</strong> to <strong>make</strong>.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for the Watcher</h2>
		<p class="bold">First step:</p>
		<p>Search for the folder where you keep your Allegro projects. For proper operation, I suggest that you create
		a folder to keep only the .c files and their corresponding assets.</p>
		<p class="bold">Second step:</p>
		<p>Search the folder where your Allegro library were downloaded. The name should contain the Allegro version.</p>
		<p class="bold">Third step:</p>
		<p>Now you should confirm if the path on text fields are correct and in the right order (the first text field should
		have Allegro projects folder path and the second should have Allegro library folder path)</p>
		<p>If everything is correct you can <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>

		<p>Once the paths have been submitted, you'll be redirected to the Watcher window. This means that Automake is
		already reading changes in the directory, you can now keep the app on background and work on your projects.
		Every time you save your project the app will automatically compile it into an executable.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for the Cleaner</h2>
		<p><strong style="color: #ff5a5a;">Important!</strong> The call to the Cleaner will only work if at least the Allegro folder was submitted.</p>
		<p>The Cleaner can be called clicking on the <strong>File</strong> or simply hitting <strong>Ctrl+W
		(Command+W on Mac)</strong>.</p>

		<hr/>

		<h2>Instructions for saving and opening compiled programs</h2>
		<p>The app now has the funcionality of saving your paths settings. Once you submit, a message box will appear.
		Choose "Yes" to save your settings. <strong style="color: #ff5a5a;">Important!</strong> The settings are
		temporarily saved, so, they may disappear when you reboot your computer.</p>

		<p>To load your last settings go to <strong>File</strong> and click the first option.</p>

		<p>Another new funcionality is to open the last compiled program or it's folder directly from the app. But in
		order to that you'll have to first make a modification (saving without any works too) so that Automake compiles the
		program.</p>

		<p>To load your last compiled program folder go to <strong>File</strong> and click the second option. If you
		want to open the last program itself click the third option or hit <strong>Ctrl+S (Command+S on Mac)</strong>.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>To check the source code go to <strong>Help</strong> and <strong>Learn More</strong>.</p>

		<p>Click <strong>Home</strong> or hit <strong>Ctrl+H (Command+H on Mac)</strong> to go back to the homepage.</p>
